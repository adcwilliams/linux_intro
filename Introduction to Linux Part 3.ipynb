    "## Shell Scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've seen the **BASH** shell used as a command interpreter and introduced the concept of variables. BASH is rather more than just an interpreter, however, and has a number of features of a programming language. It can be used to automate tasks in a reproducible manner by writing a _shell script_, essentially a collection of shell commands stored in a text file with the  _executable_ bit set. Shell scripts generally have the `.sh` filename extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Structure of a Script\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical shell script has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Description of my shell script\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"Hello from a shell script\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This very simple example has three sections:\n",
    "\n",
    " * The invocation line, `#!/bin/bash`. This line tells Linux which command interpreter we want to use to execute the following commands. There are other shell interpreters, but BASH is by far the most common.\n",
    " * Comments describing what the script does. Comment lines in BASH are prefixed by a `#` symbol.\n",
    " * The main body of the script that performs the intended functions. In this case it simply prints a message to the standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples that follow, whenever you want to write a shell script simply use your favourite text editor to create a file. It doesn't matter what the file is called but if the script is part of an exercise it will be convenient to name it `exercise-x.sh`, where `x` is the exercise number. Remember to ensure that the script is marked as executable before you run it. If you haven't already created a directory to contain your work then do so now."

    "  task A\n",

    "\n",
    "Our comparison demonstrates two methods of determining a value. The first, dereferencing the variable `${mydate}`, we're already familiar with. The second, placing a command within `(brackets)` and prefixing it with a `$` actually runs that command and captures the output, which can either be assigned to a variable or, in this case, used directly. We can see what output the `date` command is generating by running it directly:"
