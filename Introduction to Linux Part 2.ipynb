    "We've seen how to create an empty file using the `touch` command, but to add content we'll need to use a text editor. There are graphical editors available for Linux, but when connected to a Linux machine over a network it's advisable to use a text-based editor that runs in the Linux terminal for improved speed. Frequently, graphical applications are not installed or blocked from running over a network in order to prevent them from hogging the available bandwidth, so it's important to become familiar with a terminal-based text editor for the occasions when that is all there is available.\n",

    "The two we'll be looking at are `nano` and `vim`. The former is simpler and more widely available, so is a good first option for a beginner, but the latter is considerably more powerful, albeit at the cost of added complexity. There are others, such as `emacs`, but that is beyond the scope of this introduction.\n",
