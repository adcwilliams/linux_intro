    "## Text Editors\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how to create an empty file using the `touch` command, but to add content we'll need to use a text editor. There are graphical editors available for Linux, but when connected to a Linux machine over a network it's advisable to use a text-based editor that runs in the Linux terminal for improved speed. Frequently, graphical applications are not installed or blocked from running over a network in order to prevent them from hogging the available bandwidth, so it's important to become familiar with a terminal-based text editor for the occasions when that is all there is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two we'll be looking at are `nano` and `vim`. The former is simpler and more widely available, so is a good first option for a beginner, but the latter is considerably more powerful, albeit at the cost of added complexity. There are others, such as `emacs`, but that is beyond the scope of this introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a text editor you'll need to have a terminal window open, so launch one now if you haven't already."

    "Nano is what is known as a _modeless_ text editor. This means that when you press a key, that text is inserted into the document being edited. Commands are issued by key combinations using the _Ctrl_ and _Alt_ keys. For example, the key combination **Ctrl + X** will exit Nano and drop back to the command prompt.\n",

    "nano myfile.txt\n",

    "Saving a file is achieved using the **Ctrl + O** combination. If you started Nano without specifying an existing file then you will be asked to enter a filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to pipe output from commands directly into Nano. For example, to create a new document containing the output from the cp help text, type:\n",

    "When a Linux tool writes output to the screen (for example, the `echo` command) it is actually writing to the _standard output_ (stdout), which is by default displayed on the screen. Likewise, many tools accept content from the _standard input_ (stdin). What we have been doing with pipes is connecting the standard output of one command to he standard input of another. There is another output pipe known as _standard error_ (stderr), which is typically used to output error messages. Like stdout, it is normally output to the screen. We can, however, control where these pipelines send and receive their data to, and this concept is known as _redirection_.\n",
