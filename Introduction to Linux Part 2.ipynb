    "## Text Editors\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how to create an empty file using the `touch` command, but to add content we'll need to use a text editor. There are graphical editors available for Linux, but when connected to a Linux machine over a network it's advisable to use a text-based editor that runs in the Linux terminal for improved speed. Frequently, graphical applications are not installed or blocked from running over a network in order to prevent them from hogging the available bandwidth, so it's important to become familiar with a terminal-based text editor for the occasions when that is all there is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two we'll be looking at are `nano` and `vim`. The former is simpler and more widely available, so is a good first option for a beginner, but the latter is considerably more powerful, albeit at the cost of added complexity. There are others, such as `emacs`, but that is beyond the scope of this introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a text editor you'll need to have a terminal window open, so launch one now if you haven't already."

    "Nano is what is known as a _modeless_ text editor. This means that when you press a key, that text is inserted into the document being edited. Commands are issued by key combinations using the _Ctrl_ and _Alt_ keys. For example, the key combination **Ctrl + X** will exit Nano and drop back to the command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start editing an empty file, type:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "nano myfile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving a file is achieved using the **Ctrl + O** combination. If you started Nano without specifying an existing file then you will be asked to enter a filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to pipe output from commands directly into Nano. For example, to create a new document containing the output from the cp help text, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cp --help | nano -\n",

When finished press the _Escape_ key to return to command mode. One of the most common mistakes when learning Vim is to start typing text whilst in command mode and inadvertently perform a command.\n",
