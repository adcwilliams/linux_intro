    "## Text Editors\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how to create an empty file using the `touch` command, but to add content we'll need to use a text editor. There are graphical editors available for Linux, but when connected to a Linux machine over a network it's advisable to use a text-based editor that runs in the Linux terminal for improved speed. Frequently, graphical applications are not installed or blocked from running over a network in order to prevent them from hogging the available bandwidth, so it's important to become familiar with a terminal-based text editor for the occasions when that is all there is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two we'll be looking at are `nano` and `vim`. The former is simpler and more widely available, so is a good first option for a beginner, but the latter is considerably more powerful, albeit at the cost of added complexity. There are others, such as `emacs`, but that is beyond the scope of this introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a text editor you'll need to have a terminal window open, so launch one now if you haven't already."

    "Nano is what is known as a _modeless_ text editor. This means that when you press a key, that text is inserted into the document being edited. Commands are issued by key combinations using the _Ctrl_ and _Alt_ keys. For example, the key combination **Ctrl + X** will exit Nano and drop back to the command prompt.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "nano myfile.txt\n",

    "\n",
    "Saving a file is achieved using the **Ctrl + O** combination. If you started Nano without specifying an existing file then you will be asked to enter a filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to pipe output from commands directly into Nano. For example, to create a new document containing the output from the cp help text, type:\n",

When finished press the _Escape_ key to return to command mode. One of the most common mistakes when learning Vim is to start typing text whilst in command mode and inadvertently perform a command.\n",

    "\n",
    "We've seen how to use pipes to redirect the output of one command to the input of another. In Linux terms these are known as the _standard output_ and _standard input_ in order to distinguish them from the _standard error_. The _standard output_ (stdout) and _standard error_ (stderr) are simply two pipelines for output from a command to take. Conventionally the former is used for general output and the latter is used for error messages. By default both are directed to the terminal window so we see both mixed together. We can, however, separate them and direct them to files rather than the terminal.\n"
