    "This short course is designed as an introduction to the Linux operating system for those who have little or no experience of using it. The aim will be to introduce the core concepts of what Linux is and can do, along with the standard array of tools and commands that will be available. More advanced concepts include shell scripting, which is an important skill for those writing job submission scripts intended to run on _High Performance Computing_ (HPC) systems."

    "An operating system acts as an interface between the applications, such as a web browser or Python data processing script, and the physical hardware, such as memory, filesystems and peripherals. It shares access to the hardware such that multiple applications and multiple users can use a single computer at the same time.\n",

    "## The Role of Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "While Linux is often encountered as a desktop operating system with a graphical interface similar to Windows, in research environments it is more frequently used as a server or HPC operating system, accessible either primarily or solely via a network. A machine such as this typically has a high workload, and to avoid overloading such a system applications (or _jobs_) typically run under a job scheduler which queues them until there are processor and memory resources available for them to run. Displaying graphical applications over a network generally stresses both the network and the machine running the application, so for efficiency tools tend to be text-based.\n",
    "These two factors determine that a typical job running on a Linux HPC system will be:\n",
    " * _Non-Interactive_: It can run without user intervention, generally by reading and writing data to files.\n",
    " * _Text-Based_: Informative output is of the form of plain text rather than graphical windows.\n",
    " \n",
    "This means that when using Linux it is important to be comfortable with controlling it via a command line interface, known as the **shell**. The shell runs in a terminal window and interprets typed commands like this: "
