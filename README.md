# Introduction to Linux

This guide provides an introduction to the use of Linux for the complete
beginner. It is based upon [training material](https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/acrc/pdf/Introduction%20to%20Linux.pdf)
developed at the Advanced Computing Research Centre, University of Bristol,
which in turn references a [guide](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
produced by the University of Surrey.
